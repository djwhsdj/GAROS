# GAROS: Genetic Algorithm-Aided Row-Skipping for SDK-Based Convolutional Weight Mapping


  ## Please use 'run_script' to evaluate the methods. 
  ## Before training, please check the mode for each method
  ### GAROS
  #### run_script_adaptive.py
    * This is a run script in ResNet-20 on CIFAR-10 and WRN16-4 on CIFAR-100
  #### run_script_adaptive_imagenet.py
    * This is a run script code in ResNet-18 on ImageNet

  ## Pattern-based pruning
  #### run_script_pattern_(ResNet20, WRN16-4, imagenet)
    * This is a run script code for pattern-based pruning methods in ResNet-20, WRN16-4, ResNet-18 repectively.
